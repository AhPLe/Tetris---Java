# Tetris---Java
A basic Tetris game designed from the Udemy class https://www.udemy.com/a-practical-intro-to-java-using-games/learn/lecture/2271238?start=690#overview

I used the Udemy Breakout to design this program. 
This program was meant to show some knowledge and capabilities in the Java language.
It is not polished, but it is functional. Some functions (rotate, dropdown, erase) were fun to create.
The biggest current issue is proper use of timers/swing/threads/sleep (or not sleeping) functionality. From there moving to improving the UI.
It may further be improved through using built in functionalities of UI layouts, both for the bricks and the menu.
Switching to a grid structure is already at least half implemented.
From there, making a full switch to a grid structure for the game would be ideal, and is half implemented already.
There was some work on changing how rotations occur in game, but it seems like most tetris programs use it,
so any changes are at the bottom of the list currently, though minor changes were already implemented
