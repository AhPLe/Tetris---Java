# Tetris---Java
A basic Tetris game designed from the Udemy class https://www.udemy.com/a-practical-intro-to-java-using-games/learn/lecture/2271238?start=690#overview

I used the Udemy Breakout to design this program. 
This program was meant to show some knowledge and capabilities in the Java language.
It is not polished, but it is functional. Some functions (rotate, dropdown, erase) were fun to create.
It may further be improved through using built in functionalities of UI layouts, both for the bricks and the menu.
From there, making a full switch to a grid structure for the game would be ideal, and is half implemented already.
Less useful for skill outside of the game, but useful for polishing is the rotating mechanism. The hinge currently 
is not the middle of the piece, but the rotation is correct.
